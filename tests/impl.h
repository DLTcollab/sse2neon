// Currently 39 SSE intrinsics have unit tests fully implemented and verified.
// There are an additional 56 intrinsics which do not yet have a unit
// test implementation and, therefore, should not be considered fully
// verified at this time.  These will be implemented as soon as possible.
// Note: The way unit tests are implemented is that 10,000 random floating point
// and integer vec4 numbers are generated as sample data.
//
// A short C implementation of every intrinsic is implemented and compared to
// the actual expected results from the corresponding SSE intrinsic against all
// of the 10,000 randomized input vectors. When running on ARM, then the results
// are compared to the NEON approximate version.
